Author: HADI, Maria Catrina O.
Section: CMSC 100 - U3L
Exercise 06


Description: This code applies the topics on week 6 discussion such as using MongoDB and Database Integration. This program first creates a database in MongoDB to be
modified using controllers and routers. You can add, update, delete, and delete all data in this program by implementing the functions created in controller.js
and running index.js for server, and request.js for post and get methods.


HOW TO USE?
1. Make sure you have installed and your MongoDB is working properly on your device.
2. Create a database and add data in your MongoDB.
3. Using your VS code, run a server and make sure there are no errors.
4. Run request.js to implement the code you created to update the data in your database.
5. Check MongoDB for changes, and do step 4 until you run all the possible operations (add, update, delete, delete all).
6. In checking the get method, paste the link on your browser and check if there are data appearing.
